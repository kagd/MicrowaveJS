Microwave.js
============

There are a lot of differnet ways out there to have a blog.  Here's what I wanted, and what I built.  If this sounds like you too, you might like microwave.js.

- I wanted to write code for blog posts in my won editor, being able to use things like tab, brace highlighting, etc.
- I didn't want to write blog posts in HTML
- I want things to be simple.  I shouldn't have to fuss around for 5 minutes just to get a blog post online

So I built microwave.js.

Out of the box it supports the following features:

- Uses YAML for configuration, making it super simple
- DISQUS integration on index and posts
- Supports both markdown code blocks and inline code
- Automatic code prettification
- Pre-configured for Heroku
